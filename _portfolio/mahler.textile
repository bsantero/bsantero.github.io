!(pure-img float-left pad-right portfolio-img-right)/assets/images/Mahler-thumbnail.png! While "Tonality":/portfolio/tonality was my first project and collaboration (with "Kai Cataldo":http://kai.codes), Mahler Box is my first solo project. At least first project I actually cared about. As a musician, I was always told "play with drones for your ear," "play with a metronome to suck less at rhythm." By and large, these people were right.

So, I decided to write these tools for myself. Mahler Box is a drone generator and metronome timer based off of the "Web Audio API":https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API. The drones and metronome clicks are simple oscillators, while the timing is done based off of a helper scheduler. Think: "Ok, I need another click in precisely 25ms, can you pencil that in? Thanks." It then loops that scheduler until you press "Stop". Cool stuff that I didn't necessarily invent, but took the concept, fleshed it out, and put a nice little bow on it.

Let me know if you have any concerns, questions, or comments with the handy contact form up on the top right. Until then, enjoy Mahler Box.
