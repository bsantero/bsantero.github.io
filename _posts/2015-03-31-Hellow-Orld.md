Yet another Hello World for my [blahg](/blahg/). I've lost track of how many blahgs I've started, but I swear, this one is the best!

No more Joomla, no more Wordpress. It's a very cool technology called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). This tech allows me (and you!) to build each site, and launch it anywhere. I don't need a super powerful server, and there's no database for anyone to hack into. It's just simple html, css, and js.

*The magic is behind the <a href="/behind/the/curtain/index.html" class="hidden-link">curtain</a>.*
