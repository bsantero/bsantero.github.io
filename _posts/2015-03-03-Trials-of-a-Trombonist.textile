Every day it's about making yourself better, right? I've considered this to be a falsism. You hear it in many ways: "it's about the journey", "[deity] put me here for some reason", "Bubba smash BUG!" No matter how you say it, we feel like we need purpose. I'm a classically trained orchestral musician in my life, but that hasn't been my PURPOSE per se. Each day, I wake up and precisely *don't* have a burning desire in my heart. Each day is another chance for me to figure out what I want in my life, but also what I can do with others.
