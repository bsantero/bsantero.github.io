As a non-classically trained newcomer to the tech field, Brian has distinguished himself as a quick-learning, motivated, snazzy, buzz-worded worker. Ever since his brother "Chris Santero":http://github.com/csantero helped him build his first computer, Brian has been insatiably curious in the ways of hardware and gadgetry.

Although a recent injectee into the scene, Brian has found ways to create his own niches, whether it be through programming or recording. After graduating from the Curtis Institute of Music, Brian came under the employ of Curtis as a Video Assistant and Editor manning cameras, changing hard disks, and cutting clips. This helped him start on his audio and video recording journey.

Now at home in the booth as he is on stage, Brian is willing and able to tackle any ensemble from a solo guitar to a chamber orchestra. Or code their websites, or the metronome and drones for them to practice to. Whatever you need, Brian can help you figure it out.
